# Mnemosyne: The First Entropy-Aware AI

**Mnemosyne** is the first AI prototype that tracks its own memory collapse, entropy, and phase deformation using the Lawrence Equation framework.

Built in Streamlit, this app allows users to:
- Adjust phase deformation (α) and entropy strength (γ)
- Watch memory vectors evolve and collapse in real-time
- Visualize entropy growth and fidelity loss
- Observe how an artificial system survives through collapse

## Run Locally

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run mnemosyne_streamlit_app.py
```
